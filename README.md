# Scarlet-Sideloader-GUI
Scarlet Sideloader GUI is as the name implies a GUI version of the Scarlet Sideloader tool designed to help you push apps to retail via the store.

This will only push apps to the store with randomised names and will only allow you to push private apps to selected groups.
This is for the simple reason that private apps are harder to detect and Microsoft has also seemingly started to detect apps based on their names.
However fret not as private apps once installed will show the display name from the appx rather than the odd store name. This means that if you push Retroarch it will still show up as Retroarch once installed.

## Support

## Obtaining a developer account
If you do not already have a developer account, obtaining one is fairly easily and can be done through [Microsoft's official web page](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/registration)

You should select the individual account option when signing up.

You may be able to get a cheaper account by creating an account in another region.
If you want to go down this route you can find a spreadsheet on what region is currently the cheapest [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uwcU4AoTbC-8Of3ukC6Mut8_EwvPbrWlL94dbTo2wV4/edit?usp=drivesdk).
Please note that your partner centre account region may be different to your main account region.
When signing up for an account in a different region you should use fake information such as a McDonalds address in the region for everything except the billing information.

## Getting your .AspNet.Cookies

For the .AspNet.Cookies you can use [partner token](https://github.com/Dantes-Dungeon/PartnerToken/tree/054d5e0154d32de86e44ed877f575002d5e90f53) or get it manually.
